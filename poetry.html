    <h2>My First of Hopefully Many</h2>

    On a Friday of October 11, my bae and me were having some discussion about nobel lauretes 
    (yes, because of G. Hinton, D. Hassabis, et al) and what it takes to get one. 
    I said they all believed in and kept the pursuit of truth. She asks me, “bae, what’s the truth for you?” 
    I’m usually fast at responding to such question but this time wasn’t able to precisely articulate my 
    answer until she falls asleep. So I ended up writing a poem as my answer to her question for her to read 
    the next morning… <br>
    <br>
    "consciousness" is the truth for me... <br>
    
    because without it the question of truth doesn't make sense, it the sole thing that not only 
    perceives but also appreciates the reality, construct abstract symbols, give them meaning to 
    formulate a framework that explains reality. It detect patterns and try to make sense of them. 
    It detects patterns outside of it. Even detects the ones within it, in the chemicals required 
    of its own functioning. It call them “emotions”, which are its own states for different 
    concentrations. It studies them, and uses them to convince others of their own version of reality.
        In understaing itself, it gives rise to the emotions, to the concepts, to ideas, to the patterns 
        in the molecule interactions, to the observation of disintegration of its surroundings, even that 
        of its own kind and part itself. It gives rise:
    
    <div class="poem">
        <p> to the scare of death, to the reassure of survival <br>
            
            to the joy in discovery, to the excitement of exploration <br>
            
            to the pleasure of sex, to the "love" in obsession <br>
            
            to the love of belonging and to the belongingness when within groups <br>
            
            to the madness in art, to the discipline in sports <br>

            to the rythm in music and to the music in vibrations <br>
            
            to the pinkness of her lips, to the redness in a rose <br>
            
            to that kick in the poetry and that kiss on her nose <br>
            
            to the sharpness of a stone and the curiosity of unknown <br>
            
            to the “ideologies” of thoughts and to the “right” of freedom <br>
            
            to the theories of everything and the laws of nature <br>
            
            from attaction of atoms and to the space-time curvature <br>
            
            to the electricity in flow of electrons, and flow in magnetism <br>
            
            to the decay in a reaction and power in steam engine <br>
            
            to the framework of mathematic and to those insights from statistics <br>
            
            from nazis against laws (mind you!) not of nature, to the “careers” of a scientist and leaders <br>
            
            to the bandwidth in silicon, to the scaling in transformers <br>
            
            to the “artificialness” of intelligence, and to its abstraction in a code <br> 
            
            giving code ability to write more code, leading to the emergence of trillion ones and zeros <br>

            <br>
            
            from the zero of nothingness, to the meaning of interestingly everything; <br>
            
            —even the notion of “truth” itself. <br>
        </p>

    PS. Working on robotics means giving physical-API to the digital brains, a sufficiently essential next step for us.
